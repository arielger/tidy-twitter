[] Add logout button in sidebar
[] Use id_str in api/user (check this for all endpoints, DRY code)

    [] Front-end
    [] Also check in api endpoints (cookies should be set)
[] Add error state for all components
    [] When creating a new list (NewListModal)
    [] When fetching fails (also check background fetch of react-query)
[] Implement list edit functionality
[] Add missing handlers for msw (utils/mocks/handlers.js)
