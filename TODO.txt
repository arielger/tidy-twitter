FUNCTIONALITY
[OK] Add loading state for deleting behaviour in lists (or might use optimistic update also)
[] If there are no twitter cookies redirect to initial page (auth)
    [] Check in api endpoints (cookies should be set)
[] Add error state for all components
    [] When creating a new list (ListModal)
    [] When fetching fails (also check background fetch of react-query)
[] Add missing handlers for msw (utils/mocks/handlers.js)
[] Review if any endpoint is not returning all results (need to review pagination)
[] Move /dashboard/lists to /dashboard page
[] Add expiration to cookies
[] When getting an error for any Twitter request related to wrong credentials we should remove cookies
[] Migrate all endpoints to twitter-lite
[] Use id_str in api/user (check this for all endpoints, DRY code)
[] Handle not owned lists (you can't edit, unsubscribe instead of delete, can't add members)

NICE TO HAVE
[] Review if ESLint config is working (react/jsx-key is not showing error)
[] Improve error logging (front + back-end)
[] Add google analytics
[] Improve AddMembersDrawer style (add loading state)
[] Fix repeated map for lists of members (add types)
[] Review Twitter permissions asked
[] Add modal when trying to delete list with more than n members

CONFIG
[] Fix API requests in vercel preview links
[] Add Prettier and rules to order imports
