FUNCTIONALITY
[OK] Import all followers instead of first 200 (api/friends)
    Could use v2 API with https://github.com/draftbit/twitter-lite
    [OK] Add pagination
    [OK] Update mocks
[] Migrate all endpoints to twitter-lite
[] Add logout button in sidebar
[] Use id_str in api/user (check this for all endpoints, DRY code)
[] If there are no twitter cookies redirect to initial page (auth)
    [] Front-end
    [] Also check in api endpoints (cookies should be set)
[] Add error state for all components
    [] When creating a new list (NewListModal)
    [] When fetching fails (also check background fetch of react-query)
[] Implement list edit functionality
[] Add missing handlers for msw (utils/mocks/handlers.js)
[] Add loading state for deleting behaviour in lists (or might use optimistic update also)

NICE TO HAVE
[] Review if ESLint config is working (react/jsx-key is not showing error)
[] Improve error logging (front + back-end)
[] Add google analytics
[] Improve AddMembersDrawer style (add loading state)
[] Fix repeated map for lists of members (add types)
[] Review Twitter permissions asked
[] Add modal when trying to delete list with more than n members

CONFIG
[] Fix API requests in vercel preview links
[] Add Prettier and rules to order imports
